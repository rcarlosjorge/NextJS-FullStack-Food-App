- **Scalable Components:** Use of `useServer` and `useClient` to logically separate components, increasing scalability.
- **Dynamic Pages:** Implementation of dynamic pages using `[]` brackets for variable paths.
- **Custom Not-Found Page:** Handling of not found paths with a custom 'Not Found' page.
- **Custom Layout:** Use of Next.js metadata to improve SEO and site presentation.
